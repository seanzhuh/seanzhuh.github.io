## About Me

**"The devil lies in the details, but also macros."**

Just a short bio here, currently I'm a first year PhD student at [MAC Lab](https://mac.xmu.edu.cn/index.htm) in [XMU](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/) under the guidance of Prof. [Rongrong Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lRSD7PQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Before that, I obtained my master and bachelor degree both in CSE from XMU (2020 - 2023) and [HDU](https://www.hdu.edu.cn/main.htm) (2015 - 2019), respectively. I have also interned at Tencent [Youtu Lab](https://open.youtu.qq.com/#/open) (Jul. 2021 - Mar. 2022), Shanghai.

## Research Interests

I'm interested by many, if not all, topics that in practice, can shape and transform both industry and society, with a primary focus on perception task, be it 2D/3D/Video close-set/open-vocabulary detection/segmentation with MLLMs/Point Cloud/NeRF/3DGS involved. I'm also facinated by the beauty of coding, be it CUDA kernels, C++ extensions and so on.

## Prospective Collaboration

**I'm building a team now.** Extremely self-motivated post graduates are welcome if you are interested in my topic, please reach me via e-mail in advance. 

## Blogging

"*Writing is self-instruction and self-development*". The learning curve is high when entering a new area, online resources are typically copy-paste with little value. So my blogs are hosted via [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product) as a reminder in future, hope it is also beneficial to you guys out there ðŸ‘‹.

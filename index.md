## Blogging

"*Writing is self-instruction and self-development*". The learning curve is high when entering a new area, online resources are typically copy-paste with little value. So my blogs are hosted via [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product) as a reminder in future, hope it is also beneficial to you guys out there ðŸ‘‹.

## About Me

Just a short bio here, I'm a first-year PhD student at [CSE](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/) department of [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by Prof. [Long Chen](https://zjuchenlong.github.io/), check out our [LONG Group](https://long-group.cse.ust.hk/) also. Before that, I obtained my master and bachelor degree both in CSE from [XMU](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/) (2020 - 2023) and [HDU](https://www.hdu.edu.cn/main.htm) (2015 - 2019), respectively. I was a member of [MAC Lab](https://mac.xmu.edu.cn/index.htm) under the guidance of Prof. [Rongrong Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lRSD7PQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and worked closely with Prof. [Jun Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3XTEwtAAAAAJ&hl=en) along my past research journey. I have also interned at Tencent Youtu Lab (Jul. 2021 - Mar. 2022), Shanghai, where I was awarded the star of future prize.

## Research Interests

I'm interested by many, if not all, topics that in practice, can shape and transform both industry and society, with a primary focus on perception task, especially under the open-world scenario. Recently I've been exploring 3D reconstruction and spacetime intelligence as exemplified by embodied AI. Any research-related issue including collaboration is welcome, please reach me via e-mail w/o hesitance.
